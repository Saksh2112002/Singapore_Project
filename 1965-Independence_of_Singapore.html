    <h2>Separation from Malaysia</h2>
    <p>
      On <strong>9 August 1965</strong>, Singapore became an independent and sovereign nation. The sudden and dramatic separation from Malaysia came after a period of political and racial tensions between the central government in Kuala Lumpur and the leaders of the People's Action Party (PAP) in Singapore. Despite initial hopes of creating a unified nation, fundamental differences in ideology and economics led to growing unrest.
    </p>

    <p>
      After barely two years of merger, Malaysia's Parliament voted to expel Singapore from the federation. The announcement came as a shock to many Singaporeans, including Prime Minister <strong>Lee Kuan Yew</strong>, who broke down in tears during a televised address, calling it a "moment of anguish." Singapore now faced the daunting challenge of surviving as a tiny island nation with no natural resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Forging a New Nation</h2>
    <p>
      In the wake of independence, Singapore's leaders faced massive obstacles: high unemployment, a housing crisis, limited defense capabilities, and uncertain diplomatic standing. The government prioritized building a cohesive national identity, investing heavily in education, public housing, infrastructure, and industrialization.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lee Kuan Yew and his team implemented pragmatic and visionary policies that laid the groundwork for Singapore’s transformation into a developed nation. The Housing Development Board (HDB), Economic Development Board (EDB), and creation of National Service (NS) became cornerstones of this national building process.
    </p>

    <h2>International Recognition and Growth</h2>
    <p>
      Despite initial doubts, Singapore rapidly gained international recognition. The country joined the United Nations in 1965 and the Commonwealth shortly after. It quickly established diplomatic ties with major powers and developed an export-driven economy that attracted foreign investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the decades, Singapore evolved into a global trade hub, known for its stability, innovation, and multicultural society. Its journey from vulnerability to prosperity is often cited as a model of disciplined governance and strategic development.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy of 1965</h2>
    <p>
      The events of 1965 are seen not only as the birth of modern Singapore but also the foundation of its unique identity. The challenges of separation forged a resilient and united society, committed to self-determination, meritocracy, and multiracial harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      National Day, celebrated annually on August 9, honors the sacrifices, vision, and unity that shaped the Republic of Singapore from its most uncertain hour.
