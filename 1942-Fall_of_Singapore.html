    <h2>Prelude to War</h2>
    <p>
      In the late 1930s, with tensions rising in the Pacific, Singapore was fortified as the British Empire’s “Gibraltar of the East.” A large naval base was constructed, complete with dry docks and coastal batteries. However, despite these defenses, British military planning underestimated the threat of a Japanese invasion through Malaya.
    </p>

    <h2>Japanese Invasion</h2>
    <p>
      On 8 December 1941, the Japanese launched a lightning invasion of Malaya from Thailand. Their forces, highly mobile and experienced in jungle warfare, pushed southward quickly using bicycles and light tanks. British, Indian, and Australian forces, ill-prepared and poorly coordinated, were unable to halt the advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      By February 1942, Japanese troops had crossed the Johor Strait and landed on Singapore Island. Despite outnumbering the attackers, British troops were demoralized and poorly led. Civilian casualties mounted, infrastructure was bombed, and water supply lines were cut.
    </p>

    <h2>The Fall and Surrender</h2>
    <p>
      On 15 February 1942, British commander Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival formally surrendered to General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah. Over 80,000 Allied troops were taken prisoner — the largest British surrender in history. The Union Jack was lowered, and Singapore fell under Japanese occupation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fall of Singapore shocked the world. Winston Churchill called it the "worst disaster" and "largest capitulation" in British military history. Singapore, once thought impregnable, had fallen in just over two months.
    </p>

    <h2>Japanese Occupation (1942–1945)</h2>
    <p>
      Singapore was renamed <strong>Syonan-to</strong> (“Light of the South”) by the Japanese. The population endured brutal repression, forced labor, and food shortages. Thousands of Chinese civilians were massacred during the <strong>Sook Ching</strong> purge. Education, media, and everyday life were controlled tightly by the military regime.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resistance movements formed in secret, and many civilians supported Allied intelligence efforts. Despite the oppression, the spirit of resilience among locals remained strong until the Japanese surrender in August 1945 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

      <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The British had 85,000 troops in Singapore — nearly double the Japanese attackers — yet still lost.</li>
        <li>The coastal guns were powerful but pointed out to sea, not toward land, making them ineffective during invasion.</li>
        <li>The Japanese bombed Singapore just hours after attacking Pearl Harbor.</li>
        <li>“Syonan-to” means “Light of the South,” symbolizing Japan’s imperial vision for Southeast Asia.</li>
        <li>The Ford Motor Factory, where the surrender was signed, is now a WWII museum.</li>
        <li>Sook Ching massacres are estimated to have killed between 25,000 to 50,000 Chinese civilians.</li>
