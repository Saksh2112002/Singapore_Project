    <h2>Arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles</h2>
    <p>
      On 28 January 1819, <strong>Sir Stamford Raffles</strong>, an official of the British East India Company, arrived on the shores of Singapore. He quickly recognized the strategic importance of the island, located at the southern entrance of the Malacca Strait — one of the busiest maritime trade routes in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Raffles sought to establish a British trading post that could compete with the Dutch-controlled ports in the region. He met with the local Malay rulers, including <strong>Tengku Hussein Shah</strong>, who was installed as Sultan of Johor with British support. In return, the British were granted the right to set up a trading settlement in Singapore.
    </p>

    <h2>Founding the Modern City</h2>
    <p>
      Raffles laid out a vision for a free port with no taxes or duties, attracting merchants from across Asia and the Middle East. Within months, Singapore’s harbor bustled with ships from China, India, Europe, and the Malay Archipelago. The settlement grew rapidly, becoming a magnet for immigrants, laborers, and traders.
    </p>

    <p>
      The British presence in Singapore marked a turning point. Raffles emphasized urban planning, creating the famous <strong>Raffles Town Plan</strong>, which divided the colony into different ethnic and functional zones. He banned slavery and promoted religious freedom — policies that made Singapore unique among colonial outposts.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact on Southeast Asia</h2>
    <p>
      The founding of modern Singapore disrupted Dutch dominance in the region and shifted the balance of power. It laid the foundation for the British Straits Settlements and later the Crown Colony of Singapore. The island’s population grew from a few hundred in 1819 to tens of thousands by mid-century.
    </p>

    <p>
      Singapore’s transformation into a global trade hub began with Raffles’ landing — a historic event that shaped the economic and geopolitical future of Southeast Asia.
