    <h2>Celebrating a Milestone</h2>
    <p>
      In <strong>2015</strong>, Singapore celebrated its <strong>Golden Jubilee</strong>, marking <strong>50 years of independence</strong> since its separation from Malaysia in 1965. The event, known as <strong>SG50</strong>, was a nationwide celebration reflecting on the country's remarkable transformation from a small island nation into a modern global city.
    </p>

    <p>
      SG50 wasn’t just a celebration of the past — it was a tribute to the resilience, determination, and unity of Singaporeans across generations. The theme “<strong>Majulah Singapura</strong>” (Onward Singapore) resonated deeply, honoring pioneers while inspiring future generations to continue building a cohesive and forward-looking nation.
    </p>

    <h2>Festivities Across the Nation</h2>
    <p>
      The entire year was filled with events and tributes. From large-scale <strong>National Day Parade (NDP)</strong> performances to neighborhood carnivals, Singaporeans participated in commemorations big and small. The NDP at the Padang was especially grand, featuring multimedia shows, military displays, and fireworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Museums, schools, and grassroots organizations held exhibitions and workshops exploring the nation’s history and aspirations. Even the Merlion was bathed in a golden light to honor the SG50 spirit.
    </p>

    <h2>Honoring the Founding Generation</h2>
    <p>
      A special focus was placed on recognizing the efforts of the <strong>pioneer generation</strong> — those who laid the foundations of modern Singapore. Initiatives like the <strong>Pioneer Generation Package</strong> offered healthcare subsidies and heartfelt appreciation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The celebrations also paid tribute to Singapore’s founding Prime Minister, <strong>Lee Kuan Yew</strong>, who passed away in March 2015. His legacy was deeply felt during SG50, uniting the nation in reflection and remembrance.
    </p>

    <h2>Legacy of SG50</h2>
    <p>
      SG50 left behind more than just memories. It encouraged national pride, intergenerational dialogue, and creative expression. Projects like SG Heart Map and public art installations captured stories and dreams of citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Jubilee year became a turning point — reminding Singaporeans that their past is deeply connected to their future, and that unity and innovation remain central to the nation's success.
