    <h2>The Origin of Temasek</h2>
    <p>
      The earliest record of Singapore begins in the year <strong>1299</strong> when the kingdom of Temasek was believed to have been founded by a Sumatran prince named <strong>Sang Nila Utama</strong>. According to the Malay Annals, Sang Nila Utama was a prince from Palembang, part of the powerful <strong>Srivijaya Empire</strong>, who set out on a sea voyage in search of new lands. After a violent storm at sea, he landed on the shores of a lush, tropical island.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this island, the prince reportedly saw a strange creature — a majestic beast with a golden mane and powerful stance. His ministers claimed it was a lion, a creature he had never seen before. Taking this as a good omen, he decided to name the place <strong>“Singapura”</strong>, derived from the Sanskrit words "Simha" (lion) and "Pura" (city), meaning “Lion City.”
    </p>

    <h2>Temasek’s Strategic Role in Maritime Trade</h2>
    <p>
      Long before colonial times, Singapore’s location at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula made it a perfect maritime trading post. As early as the 13th and 14th centuries, Temasek was already mentioned in Chinese annals and Javanese texts as a thriving settlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Temasek served as a stopover point for ships navigating the maritime Silk Route between China, India, and the Middle East. Ships would dock at its shores to trade goods such as spices, silk, porcelain, ivory, and gold. It was known for being a cosmopolitan port where Indian, Arab, Chinese, and Southeast Asian traders mingled.
    </p>

    <h2>Archaeological Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      Excavations around modern-day Fort Canning Hill have revealed ancient artifacts from this early settlement. Chinese porcelain, glass beads, and Javanese-style gold ornaments point to a well-established trade-based community. These discoveries confirm that Singapore was far from being an uninhabited swamp, as once believed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fort Canning was once known as "Bukit Larangan" (Forbidden Hill), believed to be the seat of ancient rulers. A 14th-century Malay palace might have stood there, overseeing the bustling port settlement of Temasek.
    </p>

    <h2>Temasek’s Fall and Political Intrigue</h2>
    <p>
      Over the next century, Temasek became a contested region. The powerful <strong>Majapahit Empire</strong> from Java and the <strong>Ayutthaya Kingdom</strong> from Siam both attempted to control it due to its strategic value. In the 1390s, Temasek came under the influence of the Malacca Sultanate, a rising Muslim empire on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula.
    </p>

    <p>
      Temasek was eventually overshadowed by Malacca, which became the region’s main trade hub. Singapore fell into decline until the arrival of the British in 1819. But even during this “dark age,” Temasek remained on regional maps and was never completely abandoned.
    </p>

    <h2>Myth vs Reality</h2>
    <p>
      The story of Sang Nila Utama and the lion is likely a myth, as lions are not native to Southeast Asia. It’s more probable that he saw a tiger or another large animal. Yet, this myth became foundational to Singapore's identity, influencing its name, emblems, and national pride.
    </p>

    <p>
      What remains undeniable is that Singapore’s story began long before British colonization — as a port city that blended myth, trade, politics, and cultural exchanges.
